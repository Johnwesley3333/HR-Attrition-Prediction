# 🧑‍💼 HR Attrition Prediction & Dashboard

*A comprehensive analysis and prediction of employee attrition using Python and Machine Learning.*

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project analyzes **employee data** to predict **attrition probability** and helps HR teams make **data-driven retention decisions**. It includes a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive prediction.  

**Key Objectives:**  
- Predict employee attrition probability using historical data.  
- Identify top factors affecting employee turnover.  
- Build an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for HR decision-making.  
- Showcase a portfolio-ready ML project with deployment.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains **employee-level data** with attributes such as:  
- **Age** – Employee age  
- **MonthlyIncome** – Monthly salary of the employee  
- **YearsAtCompany** – Tenure at the company  
- **DistanceFromHome** – Distance of employee’s residence from office  
- **OverTime** – Whether employee works overtime (Yes/No)  
- **JobRole** – Role of the employee in the company  
- **JobSatisfaction** – Job satisfaction level (1=Low, 4=High)  
- **Attrition** – Target variable (Yes/No)  

**Size:** Approximately X rows × Y columns (replace with actual numbers).
